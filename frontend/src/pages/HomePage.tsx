        <h2>About the SM2 Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
          The SuperMemo 2 (SM2) algorithm is a spaced repetition algorithm developed by Piotr Wozniak
          in the 1980s. It optimizes the learning process by scheduling reviews at increasing intervals
          based on how well you recall the information.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you review a flashcard, you rate your recall quality on a scale of 0-5:
        </p>
        <ul className="recall-grades">
          <li><strong>5</strong> - Perfect recall</li>
          <li><strong>4</strong> - Correct recall after hesitation</li>
          <li><strong>3</strong> - Correct recall with difficulty</li>
          <li><strong>2</strong> - Incorrect recall, but the answer seemed familiar</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> - Incorrect recall, but you remembered after seeing the answer</li>
          <li><strong>0</strong> - Complete blackout</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Based on your rating, the algorithm adjusts the interval before the next review:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Higher ratings (3-5) increase the interval</li>
          <li>Lower ratings (0-2) reset the interval to 1 day</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This approach ensures you review difficult items more frequently while spacing out reviews
          for items you know well, optimizing your study time.
        </p>
